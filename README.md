Missing Persons Cases in the United States During 2020

In this capstone project I will create a presentation looking at missing persons cases in
the United States, and how the characteristics of this group compare to the US population in 2020. In addition, I will bring in US National Parks data to compare to.  I will
be using the NamUs(National Missing and Unidentified Persons System) database, US Census data, and  National Parks data for geospatial analysis. I am utilizing Python, Tableau, and Canva presentation for this data analysis to create a detailed presention. I anticipate needing to
clean NamUs and Census data due to inconsistencies in reports due to level of detail known, age of
case, regional differences, and how the data was input.

My motivation for this project is an interest in US crime and missing cases, as well as an interest in the outdoors and the US wilderness. I hope to investigate the relationship between these two interests.

Data Question: How do missing persons cases correlate with with US Census data breakdown and US National Park data during 2020?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Intended audience: peers, final capstone presentation for Nashville Software School DDA11, others interested in missing persons data in the US
Visualizations: using Tableau and Canva dashboarding/presentation tools
Analysis: Using Python (jupyter notebook) and Tableau

Schedule (through 1/4/24)
1. Get the Data (11/21/23)
2. Clean & Explore the Data (12/1/23)
3. Create Presentation of your Analysis (12/15/23)
4. Internal demos (12/15/23)
5. Demo Day!! (1/4/24)

Data Sources
1. NamUs - National Missing and Unidentified Persons System - https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Search
2. US Census Data (2020)
3. US National Park Service Data

Known Issues and Challenges
1. NamUs data will need to be cleaned to narrow down details of the cases, some data missing due to limited details surrounding case
2. Need to narrow data down - year:2020, region: US excluding Alaska
3. Utilizing geospatial data where needed
4. Cleanup/reformatting of US Census data to work well with NamUs data
